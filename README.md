  Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence where a computer/machine learns from the past experiences (input data) and makes future predictions. The performance of such a system should be at least human level.  “A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E." By Tom M. Mitchell’s (1997) Basically, Machine Learning is generally categorized into three types: (a) Supervised Learning (b) Unsupervised Learning (c) Reinforcement learning  In this project, I have prepare small datasets including the basics concepts of Machine Learnig.
